3 Destroyers (size 2)
4 Submarines (size 1)

Ensures ships are placed only horizontally or vertically
Prevents ships from touching each other, including diagonally
Efficient scanning and marking of ship parts
Easy to test with 2D integer arrays (int[,])

-Technologies Used
Language: C#

Environment: .NET / Visual Studio / Codewars

-Files

Call the static method:
bool isValid = BattleshipField.ValidateBattlefield(field);

field should be a 10x10 int[,] array where:

1 = part of a ship
